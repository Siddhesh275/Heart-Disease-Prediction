# Heart-Disease-Prediction

Prevention of Heart disease is very crucial. Machine Learning helps in predicting the Heart disease, and the predictions made are quite accurate.

The project involved analysis of the heart disease patient dataset with proper data processing. Then, different models were trained and and predictions are made with different algorithms KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest,Logistic Regression etc.
This is the jupyter notebook code and dataset I've used is provided below.

I've used a variety of Machine Learning algorithms, implemented in Python using Scikit-learn library to predict the presence of heart disease in a patient. This is a classification problem, with input features as a variety of parameters, and the target variable as a binary variable, predicting whether heart disease is present or not.

Machine Learning algorithms used:

1. Logistic Regression (Scikit-learn)
2. Naive Bayes (Scikit-learn)
3. K-Nearest Neighbours (Scikit-learn)
4. Decision Tree (Scikit-learn)
5. Random Forest (Scikit-learn)

Accuracy achieved: 95% (Logistic Regression)
